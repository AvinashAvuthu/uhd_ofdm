This project is a modification of the OFDM tunnel code from gnuradio to use UHD.

You may have to account for frequency offsets when using OFDM between two USRPs. You can do this 
manually by transmitting from one USRP on the desired frequency (in our examples 648.8M). At the
receiver, use an FFT to view the OFDM signal. There should be two null subcarriers right in the
center of the OFDM boxcar. Those should be centered around your center frequency. Adjust the 
tx frequency until it's as close as you can get.



To use the benchmark scripts:
-----------------------------
Note: I found that I had an overall frequency offset of about 1KHz, so my frequency settings are
not the same in these examples. You'll have to figure out your offset yourself.

TX side: python benchmark_ofdm_tx.py -f 648.801M -v --gain=11.5 -M 15 --tx-amplitude=.8 --rate=1M
RX side: python benchmark_ofdm_rx.py -f 648.8M -v --rx-gain=17 --rate=1M

To use ofdm_csma_ca_test:
-------------------------

python ofdm_csma_ca_test.py -f 648.8M -v
